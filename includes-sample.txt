# This is a comment. Lines beginning with # are ignored.

# Specify a page name, followed by a colon, and then one include per line following.
# Use a blank line to separate pages. Whitespace is stripped, so feel free to use
# tabs or spaces to improve readability. You can specify a page name more than once
# and the includes will just be joined together.


# Single include for a single page

# Pages inside folders work just fine too:
services/web-design:
	hover-animations.js


# Or, include every page in a folder (and its subfolders) by ending with a slash:
take-a-tour/:
	tour.css


# Or, load for every page by specifying it outside of a page group:
common.css

# Just remember to put a blank line before the next page definition.


# By default, JS files will be loaded from /assets/js
# and CSS from /assets/css, but if you prefix your
# path with a slash, MicroSite will look from the root
# of your site

# Who wants to repeat the same lines over and over?
# Instead, you can make up a group, and then include it
# in any (even many) page definitions, by using @made_up_group_name
# Just be sure the group name doesn't conflict with a page name,
# or assets might be loaded unpredictably.

# You can also load global files for specific domains. So, for example,
# you can load certain libraries only in your development environment.
# Just prefix the domain with a asterisk (*), and then treat the rest
# like you do your page-specific includes:

*localhost:
	//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/less.js/1.7.4/less.min.js


# If you specify a CSS file and it cannot be found, MicroSite will
# check for the existence of a LESS file in its place. If one is found,
# it will be added to the output. Just make sure you load a LESS compiler
# to your includes!

# The same rule will apply to files that are automatically included by
# matching the page name.


# The end!
